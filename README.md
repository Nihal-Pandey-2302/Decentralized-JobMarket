Why are we presenting this solution in Sustainability Hackathon ?

## Problems :

1) rapid expansion of cryptocurrency, In 2019, the global cryptocurrency market was approximately $793 million. It’s now expected to reach nearly $5.2 billion by 2026.

2) increasing popularity of cryptocurrency has environmentalists on edge, as the digital “mining” of it creates a massive carbon footprint due to the staggering amount of energy it requires.

3) increasing popularity of cryptocurrency has environmentalists on edge, as the digital “mining” of it creates a massive carbon footprint due to the staggering amount of energy it requires.

4) the carbon footprint of Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, is nearly 37 megatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year.

## Solutions:

1) Ethereum, the world’s first and largest smart contract platform, an almost net-zero technology positioned for sustainable future growth, reducing its carbon footprint by over 99.99%, according to a new report from CCRI (Crypto Carbon Ratings
 Institute), commissioned by Consensys.

2) Ethereum’s electricity consumption has reduced by over 99.988%, from nearly 23 million megawatt-hours per year to just over 2,600. As a result, CO2 emissions are down 99.992%, from over 11 million tons annually to under 870.

## Installation and Running Guidelines

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension for wallet integration
- Access to the relevant testnet (e.g., Polygon Testnet) and testnet funds for testing transactions

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Decentralized-JobMarket.git
   cd Decentralized-JobMarket

### Install Dependencies

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install

Configure Environment:
Rename .env.example to .env and update it with:

Your project’s contract address
Testnet details
Private key (where required) for deployment
Open hardhat.config.js (or hardhat.js) and add your private key in the designated sections to ensure secure configuration for the desired network (e.g., Polygon or Ethereum testnet).

### Running the Project
**Run the Local Development Server:**

``` bash
npm start
```
The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000.
